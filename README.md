Hi, I’m @djblackett, also known as David Andrea. I'm a programmer, teacher, musician, and philosophy nerd. 
I’m interested in creating back end systems, mostly in Java at the moment, but I dabble in Node.js and Python as well. I might like to branch out into audio software eventually, but that requires more C++ than I currently know.

I've been learning Java and the Spring framework, building projects in order to get a sense of how software is put together at larger scales. My immediate goals are to explore the Spring framework in more depth and to integrate a front end onto the backend apps I have already written. 

**Update: Nov 2021**  
I'm digging more into web development so I can build UIs that interface with my backend apps. Java has taken a bit of a back seat to this for the moment, but the goal is to integrate them. 

**Update Aug 2022:**  
I've been doing a lot of web development with React, Redux, Styled Components, and some TypeScript, and am continuing to explore the React ecosystem more deeply. 
My latest finished project is [Where in the World?](https://djblackett.github.io/rest-countries-api/), which is based on a professional design provided by [Frontend Mentor](https://frontendmentor.io) and is coded in TypeScript using the React framework.

I’m looking to collaborate on anything interesting, especially if it involves education, music, or philosophy.  


I was a content writer for JetBrains Academy/Hyperskill, where I wrote articles and practice exercises about Java. Most of my content so far has been about new features added in Java since Java 9. I'm temporarily taking a hiatus from this due to the war in Ukraine.
