Hi, Iâ€™m @djblackett. Also known as David Andrea. I'm a programmer, teacher, musician, and philosophy nerd. 
Iâ€™m interested in creating back end systems, mostly in Java at the moment, but I dabble in Node.js and Python as well. I might like to branch out into audio software eventually, but that requires more C++ than I currently know.

Iâ€™m currently learning Java and the Spring framework. I've been building projects in order to get a sense of how software is put together at larger scales. My immediate goals are to explore the Spring framework in more depth and to integrate a front end onto the backend apps I have already written. 



I am currently a content writer for JetBrains Academy. 

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything interesting.
