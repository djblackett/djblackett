- 👋 Hi, I’m @djblackett
- 👀 I’m interested in creating back end systems, mostly in Java at the moment. 
   I might like to branch out into audio software eventually, but that requires more C++ than I currently know. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java and the Spring framework, 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything interesting
- 📫 How to reach me ...
