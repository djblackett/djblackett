- 👋 Hi, I’m @djblackett. I'm a programmer, teacher, musician, and philosophy nerd. 
- 👀 I’m interested in creating back end systems, mostly in Java at the moment, but I dabble in Node.js and Python as well. 
   I might like to branch out into audio software eventually, but that requires more C++ than I currently know. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java and the Spring framework. I've been building projects in order to get a sense of how software is put together at larger scales. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything interesting. 
- 📫 How to reach me ...
