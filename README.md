Hi, I’m @djblackett, also known as David Andrea. I'm a programmer, teacher, musician, and philosophy nerd. 
I’m interested in creating back end systems, mostly in Java at the moment, but I dabble in Node.js and Python as well. I might like to branch out into audio software eventually, but that requires more C++ than I currently know.

I've been learning Java and the Spring framework. I've been building projects in order to get a sense of how software is put together at larger scales. My immediate goals are to explore the Spring framework in more depth and to integrate a front end onto the backend apps I have already written. 

As of now (Nov 2021), I'm digging more into web development so I can build UIs that interface with my backend apps. Java has taken a bit of a back seat to this for the moment, but the goal is to integrate them. 


I am currently a content writer for JetBrains Academy/Hyperskill, where I write articles and practice exercises about Java. Most of my content so far has been about new features added in Java since Java 9. 

I’m looking to collaborate on anything interesting. 


I've written some educational articles on Java for JetBrains Academy (HyperSkill):  
- [Java Switch Expressions](https://hyperskill.org/learn/step/16036)
- [Reducing Boilerplate Code with Lombok](https://hyperskill.org/learn/step/13983)
- [Introduction to Java Modules](https://hyperskill.org/learn/step/15647)
- [Java Text Blocks](https://hyperskill.org/learn/step/17316)

I also write [humorous articles aimed at beginner programmers.](https://medium.com/@daveandrea)
